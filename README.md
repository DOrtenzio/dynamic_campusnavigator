# Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture consisting of four primary layers.

```text

│         User Interface      │
│   HTML • CSS • Components   │
└──────────────┬──────────────┘

# 3D Engine

## Camera System

The platform uses an orthographic camera to maintain consistent proportions across the environment.

### Camera Modes

| Mode           | Purpose                |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Overview       | Full campus navigation |
| Building Focus | Building inspection    |
| Indoor View    | Room exploration       |

### Smooth Interpolation

Camera movement uses frame-based interpolation to ensure fluid transitions between navigation states.

---

## Floor Separation System

Each floor is generated as an independent 3D group.

When a floor is selected:

* Upper floors move upward
* Lower floors move downward
* Exterior walls become transparent
* Interior rooms become visible

This creates an exploded architectural view.

---

## Pathfinding System

Navigation routes are generated through waypoint networks.

```text
Origin
 ↓
Campus Network
 ↓
Building Entrance
 ↓
Target Floor
 ↓
Destination Room
```

Animated visual indicators are rendered directly inside the 3D scene.

---

# Data Configuration

All environment data is stored inside:

```text
data.js
```

## Buildings

```javascript
{
  id: "A",
  x: 10,
  z: 15,
  w: 20,
  d: 12,
  floors: 3
}
```

## Rooms

```javascript
{
  id: "A-101",
  floor: 1,
  type: "class"
}
```

## Supported Types

| Type    | Description     |
| ------- | --------------- |
| class   | Classroom       |
| lab     | Laboratory      |
| office  | Office          |
| special | Custom Facility |

---

# User Interface System

The visual language follows a dark claymorphism design system.

## Design Principles

* Consistent spacing
* Soft elevation hierarchy
* High readability
* Mobile-first layouts
* Touch-friendly controls
* Smooth transitions

## Layer Hierarchy

| Element             | z-index |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| Toast Notifications | 300     |
| Modal Windows       | 100     |
| Bottom Sheets       | 25      |
| Floor Selector      | 20      |
| Room Labels         | 18      |
| WebGL Canvas        | 1       |

# Security & Privacy

## Privacy First

Navi^FROM^gate is designed as a client-side application.

Benefits:

* No mandatory user accounts
* No server-side processing
* No personal data storage
* No third-party analytics required
* No tracking infrastructure by default

## Data Collection
